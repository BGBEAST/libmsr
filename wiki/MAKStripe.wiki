#summary MAKStripe driver specification

= Introduction =

The MAKStripe is hardware produced by the fine people at MAKInterface. The MAKStripe does not have a public specification. We have reverse engineered what we believe is a nearly complete specification. We have done this by observing and decoding the raw bytes on the USB bus when driven by their non-free software.
